Event Management Database created in SQL, loaded with sample formatted data, and queries to test the integrity of entity relationships

# Event Management System Database
# Project Overview
This repository contains the SQL schema and queries for an Event Management System designed for an event planning and management company. This system is tailored to efficiently manage venues, handle ticket sales, and organize event operations. The project demonstrates the robustness of the planned database by ensuring all constraints and references work as intended without the development of a frontend application interface.

# Features
Schema Design: Detailed design of database schema including tables for venues, events, attendees, tickets, and speakers.
Data Integrity: Implementation of primary and foreign keys to maintain data integrity and enforce relational links between tables.
Query Functionality: A set of SQL queries that demonstrate data manipulation and retrieval, including:
Joining multiple tables to provide comprehensive event details.
Reporting and analytics capabilities, such as calculating total ticket sales and evaluating speaker impact on revenue.
Advanced query examples that show filtering and sorting data to support event management operations.

# Database Schema
The schema consists of the following main entities:

Venue: Information about event locations.

Event: Details of specific events.

Attendee: Data about individuals attending events.

Ticket: Records of ticket sales.

Speaker: Information about event speakers.

Relationships and keys are meticulously defined to showcase how the system handles complex queries and maintains data consistency.
